<p><em>Update 2011-09-28: Both the name and the hosting of this library have changed since this post was first published. See the <a href="https://github.com/janmarthedal/kanooth-numbers">project page</a> for up-to-date information.</em></p>
<p>I am very excited about this release. The library has been redesigned and almost everything has been rewritten. Even the name has changed, it is now called Sputsoft Numbers (instead of SputArithmetic).</p>
<p><span id="more-1354"></span></p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A generic, portable backend that should make compilation possible on practically every modern C++ compiler and architecture.</li>
<li>Compilation against a <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> backend, which leads to high performance programs (requires that the system has installed the GMP library, of course).</li>
<li>Usage of smart pointers which make pass-by-value and return-by-value extremely cheap operations.</li>
<li>All functions have a common interface, such as <span class="sputcode">add(z, x, y)</span> or <span class="sputcode">mul(z, x, y).</span></li>
<li>Operators such as <span class="sputcode">+</span>, <span class="sputcode">-</span>, <span class="sputcode">*</span> and <span class="sputcode">/</span> have been overloaded to enable generic programming and more elegant code.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more <a href="https://github.com/janmarthedal/kanooth-numbers">about the library</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sputsoftnumbers/files/">download the code</a>.</p>
