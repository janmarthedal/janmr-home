<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan</a> <a href="http://oeis.org/A000108">number</a> \(C_n\) denotes the number of forests with <span class="mthi">n</span> nodes. In fact, the Catalan numbers relate to many different structures, see, e.g., the pages linked to above and the references on those pages.</p>
<p><span id="more-1953"></span></p>
<p>A formula for the Catalan numbers is given by<br />
\[<br />
C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{n! (n+1)!}<br />
\]<br />
with the asymptotic behaviour<br />
\[<br />
C_n \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n} (n+1)}.<br />
\]</p>
<p>But where did that pi come from? What do trees have to do with pi? That was the subject of Donald E. Knuth&#8217;s 16th Annual Christmas Tree Lecture, given on December 6, 2010.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a connection between the asymptotic behaviour of Catalan numbers and circle areas can be found through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product">Wallis product formula</a>,<br />
\[<br />
\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdots.<br />
\]</p>
<p>In 2007, Johan W&auml;stlund from Link&ouml;ping University published a paper called <i>An Elementary Proof of the Wallis Product Formula for pi</i> (The American Mathematical Monthly, 2007, volume 114, issue 10, pp. 914). He shows a beautiful elementary proof that relates the infinite product on the right-hand side above to the area of circles. The paper is also available <a href="http://www.ep.liu.se/ea/lsm/2005/002/">online</a>.</p>
<p>Knuth uses this result to show how pi appears in the asymptotic formula for Catalan numbers. In fact, the same result also explains why pi appears in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling's_approximation">Stirling&#8217;s formula</a>,<br />
\[<br />
n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n.<br />
\]<br />
See, e.g., exercise 1.2.11.2&ndash;5 in <a href="/book/link.php?id=taocp1">The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1</a>.</p>
<p>You can watch the lecture by Knuth by going to the <a href="http://scpd.stanford.edu/knuth/index.jsp">Computer Musings by Professor Donald E. Knuth</a> page at Stanford University (<em>update 2013-06-30:</em> direct link no longer working). I highly recommend it.</p>
