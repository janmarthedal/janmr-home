<p>How do you calculate the point where two lines in the plane intersect? It is not very hard to do, but the formula can look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line-line_intersection&#038;oldid=330824670">quite complicated</a>, depending on how you write it up. This article is a reminder that it can be expressed in a simple manner.</p>
<p><span id="more-1247"></span></p>
<p>We start out by not restricting ourselves to the plane, but any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">vector space</a> with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product">inner product</a> \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\). Let two lines be represented as</p>
<div style="float:right">(1)</div>
<p>\[<br />
\hbox{p} + s \hbox{v}, \quad s \in \mathbb{R}<br />
\]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[<br />
\hbox{q} + t \hbox{w}, \quad t \in \mathbb{R}<br />
\]</p>
<p>where \(\hbox{p}\), \(\hbox{q}\), \(\hbox{v}\), and \(\hbox{w}\) are vectors. We assume that both \(\hbox{v}\) and \(\hbox{w}\) are non-null. See Figure&nbsp;1.</p>

</figure>

<p>We look for values of \(s\) and \(t\) such that</p>
<div style="float:right">(2)</div>
<p>\[<br />
\hbox{p} + s \hbox{v} = \hbox{q} + t \hbox{w}.<br />
\]</p>
<p>Let \(\hat{\hbox{w}} \neq 0\) be a vector perpendicular to \(\hbox{w}\), \(\langle \hbox{w}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = 0\). We get</p>
<div style="float:right">(3)</div>
<p>\[<br />
s \langle \hbox{v}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = \langle \hbox{q} - \hbox{p}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle<br />
\]</p>
<p>Now if \(\langle \hbox{v}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = 0\) there are two possibilities: If \(\langle \hbox{q} &#8211; \hbox{p}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = 0\) there are infinitely many solutions, i.e., the lines overlap, but if \(\langle \hbox{q} &#8211; \hbox{p}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle \neq 0\) there are no solutions, i.e., the lines are parallel and do not intersect.</p>
<p>Assume then \(\langle \hbox{v}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle \neq 0\). We get</p>
<p>\[<br />
s = \frac{\langle \hbox{q} - \hbox{p}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle}{\langle \hbox{v}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle},<br />
\]</p>
<p>and thus, after inserting into&nbsp;(1), the point of intersection is</p>
<p>\[<br />
\hbox{p} + \frac{\langle \hbox{q} - \hbox{p}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle}{\langle \hbox{v}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle} \hbox{v}.<br />
\]</p>
<h2>The Plane is Special</h2>
<p>The derivation above is actually a little careless. If&nbsp;(2) is to hold for some \(s\) and \(t\), then&nbsp;(3) must also hold. Turning the implication the other way, which we would like to, is less straightforward.</p>
<p>Assume that&nbsp;(3) holds for some value of&nbsp;\(s\),</p>
<div style="float:right">(4)</div>
<p>\[<br />
\langle s \hbox{v} + \hbox{p} - \hbox{q}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = 0.<br />
\]</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means that the vectors \(s \hbox{v} + \hbox{p} &#8211; \hbox{q}\) and \(\hat{\hbox{w}}\) are perpendicular to each other, and if we are in two dimensions/the plane we must have \(s \hbox{v} + \hbox{p} &#8211; \hbox{q} = t \hbox{w}\) for some value of \(t\). This is&nbsp;(2) and we are done.</p>
<p>Does this work in higher dimensions? Generally, no. Consider, e.g., three dimensions and Equation&nbsp;(4). What can we derive of it now? We have that</p>
<p>\[<br />
s \hbox{v} + \hbox{p} - \hbox{q} = \alpha \hbox{w}_1 + \beta \hbox{w}_2<br />
\]</p>
<p>for some values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) and where \(\langle \hbox{w}_1, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = \langle \hbox{w}_2, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = 0\). And \(\alpha \hbox{w}_1 + \beta \hbox{w}_2 = t \hbox{w}\) does not necessarily hold for any \(t\), so&nbsp;(2) does generally not follow in three dimensions or more.</p>
<h2>Summary Using Coordinates</h2>
<p>Let us consider the usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry">two-dimensional Euclidean</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space">space</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian coordinates</a>. We set</p>
<p>\[<br />
\hbox{p} = (p_1,p_2), \quad \hbox{q} = (q_1,q_2), \quad<br />
\hbox{v} = (v_1,v_2), \quad \hbox{w} = (w_1,w_2),<br />
\]</p>
<p>and use the inner product</p>
<p>\[<br />
\langle (a_1,a_2), (b_1,b_2) \rangle = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2.<br />
\]</p>
<p>Rotating a vector \(\hbox{w} = (w_1,w_2)\) counterclockwise by a right angle is easily done with \(\hat{\hbox{w}} = (-w_2, w_1)\). It is easily checked that \(\langle \hbox{w}, \hat{\hbox{w}} \rangle = 0\).</p>
<p>Recall that we are interested in knowing whether the two lines</p>
<p>\[<br />
(x,y) = (p_1,p_2) + s (v_1,v_2), \quad s \in \mathbb{R}<br />
\]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[<br />
(x,y) = (q_1,q_2) + t (w_1,w_2), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}<br />
\]</p>
<p>intersect.</p>
<p>Setting \(\alpha = w_1 v_2 &#8211; w_2 v_1\) and \(\beta = w_1 (q_2-p_2) &#8211; w_2 (q_1-p_1)\), we have</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\alpha = 0\), \(\beta = 0\): The two lines overlap.
</li>
<li>\(\alpha = 0\), \(\beta \neq 0\): The lines are parallel but do not intersect.
</li>
<li>\(\alpha \neq 0\): The lines meet at a single point, \((p_1 + \frac{\beta}{\alpha} v_1, p_2 + \frac{\beta}{\alpha} v_2)\).
</li>
</ul>
