<p>Let us consider short division, by which we mean a multiple-digit number \(u = (u_{m-1} \ldots u_1 u_0)_b\) divided by a single digit \(v\) (see, e.g., <a href="/blog/2011/10/multiple-precision-number-representation.html">post on number representation</a>). We will assume \(m \geq 1\), \(u_{m-1} \neq 0\) and \(0 &lt; v &lt; b\).</p>
<p>We are interested in a quotient \(q = \lfloor u/v \rfloor\) and a remainder \(r\) such that \(u = q v + r\) with \(0 \leq r &lt; v\). Using that \(b^{m-1} \leq u &lt; b^m\) and \(0 &lt; v &lt; b\) we can deduce that \(b^{m-2} &lt; q &lt; b^m\) which means that \(q\) can be represented using \(m-1\) or \(m\) digits: \(q = (q_{m-1} \ldots q_1 q_0)_b\) (we may have \(q_{m-1} = 0\) in which case \(q_{m-2} \neq 0\)).</p>
<p><span id="more-2669"></span></p>
<p>We now have the following straightforward algorithm:</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm S</strong>. Given \(u = (u_{m-1} \ldots u_1 u_0)_b\) and \(0 &lt; v &lt; b\) with \(m \geq 1\) and \(u_{m-1} \neq 0\), this algorithm computes the quotient \(q = (q_{m-1} \ldots q_1 q_0)_b = \lfloor u/v \rfloor\) (we may have \(q_{m-1} = 0\) in which case \(q_{m-2} \neq 0\) if \(m &gt; 1\)) and the remainder \(r_0\) such that \(u = q v + r_0\), \(0 \leq r_0 &lt; v\).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S1</strong>. Set \(r_m \leftarrow 0\), \(k \leftarrow m-1\).</li>
<li><strong>S2</strong>. Set \(q_k \leftarrow \lfloor (r_{k+1} b + u_k)/v \rfloor\), \(r_k \leftarrow (r_{k+1} b + u_k) \hbox{ mod } v\).</li>
<li><strong>S3</strong>. If \(k=0\) then exit. Otherwise set \(k \leftarrow k-1\) and go to step&nbsp;<strong>S2</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the definition of integer division and modulus, the quantities in step <strong>S2</strong> imply \(r_{k+1} b + u_k = q_k v + r_k\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1\). Using this, we can show the correctness of the algorithm:<br />
\[
\begin{align}
u &#038;= \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} u_k b^k = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (q_k v + r_k - r_{k+1} b) b^k = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} q_k b^k v + \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} r_k b^k - \sum_{k=1}^m r_k b^k \\
  &#038;= q v + r_0 - r_m b^m = q v + r_0
\end{align}
\]
since \(r_m = 0\). It is clear from the definition of \(r_k\) that \(0 \leq r_k &lt; v\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, m\). Considering now the definition of \(q_k\) we see that since \(r_{k+1} b + u_k \leq (v-1) b + b-1 = b v &#8211; 1\) we will have \(0 \leq q_k &lt; b\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1\).</p>
<p>Note two important things: During the course of the algorithm, we only need to keep track of one \(r\)-value, not one for each \(k\) (it just made the analysis easier). Note also that each entry of \(u\) can be overwritten with the coefficients/digits of \(q\), possibly saving some storage.</p>
