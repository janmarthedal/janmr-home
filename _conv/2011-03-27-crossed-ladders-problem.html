<p>I was <a href="https://twitter.com/divbyzero/status/44871018350784512">recently reminded</a> of the crossed ladders problem. The following simple figure should be adequate in defining the problem:</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the problem before, I highly recommend trying to solve it before reading on.</p>

<p>I had previously tried to solve it, but without success. This time I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my mind. I had become a (self-inflicted) victim of <em>nerd sniping</em>.</p>

<p>The thing is that it looks simple. But <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/fy6iu/35_years_on_and_i_still_cant_solve_it/">it isn&#8217;t</a>. Below is my solution to the problem (using some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_ladders_problem">inspiration</a> for making it a bit more pretty).</p>
<p>First, some variables must be introduced. Consider the following figures:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/media/crossed-ladders-vars.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Variables for the Crossed Ladders Problem">
  <figcaption>Variables for the crossed ladders problem</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So \(a=|AF|\), \(b=|BE|\), and \(h=|CD|\) are given while the width \(w=|AB|\) is the sought quantity. Furthermore, \(p=|BF|\) and \(q=|AE|\) are auxilliary variables.</p>
<p>Consider first the special case \(a=b\). It is then clear that<br />
\[<br />
w = \sqrt{a^2-4h^2} \quad\hbox{for } a=b.<br />
\]</p>
<p>Assume now, without loss of generality, that \(a &gt; b\). The Pythegorean theorem gives us</p>
<div style="float:right">(1)</div>
<p>\[<br />
w^2 = a^2-p^2 = b^2-q^2 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad<br />
a^2-b^2 = p^2-q^2 = (p+q)(p-q).<br />
\]<br />
We then use that the triangle ACD is similar to AFB, just like the triangle BDC is similar to BAE, and get<br />
\[<br />
\frac{|AD|}{w} = \frac{h}{p} \quad\hbox{and}\quad<br />
\frac{|BD|}{w} = \frac{h}{q}.<br />
\]<br />
This gives us<br />
\[<br />
w = |AD|+|BD| = w \left( \frac{h}{p} + \frac{h}{q} \right)<br />
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad<br />
pq = h(p+q).<br />
\]<br />
We use this equality to get</p>
<div style="float:right">(2)</div>
<p>\[<br />
\begin{align}<br />
(p-q)^2 &#038;= p^2+q^2-2 p q = p^2+q^2+2 p q-4 p q \\<br />
 &#038;= (p+q)^2-4 h(p+q) = (p+q)(p+q-4h).<br />
\end{align}<br />
\]<br />
We now start from (1) and use (2) to get<br />
\[<br />
(a^2-b^2)^2 = (p+q)^2 (p-q)^2 = (p+q)^3 (p+q-4h).<br />
\]<br />
We finally divide each side by \(\sqrt{a^2-b^2}^4\) and obtain</p>
<div style="float:right">(3)</div>
<p>\[<br />
x^3 (x-c) - 1 = 0<br />
\]<br />
where</p>
<div style="float:right">(4)</div>
<p>\[<br />
x = \frac{p+q}{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}} \quad\hbox{and}\quad<br />
c = \frac{4h}{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}.<br />
\]<br />
Let us take a closer look at (3) by considering the fourth degree polynomium \(Q(x)=x^3 (x-c) &#8211; 1\). Note first that <span class="mthi">c</span> is positive. Next that <span class="mthi">Q</span> is decreasing for \(x &lt; 0\) and \(0 &lt; x &lt; 3c/4\) and increasing for \(x &gt; 3c/4\) (seen from the derivative \(Q&#8217;(x)=x^2(4x-3c)\)). And since \(Q(0)=-1\) we then know that <span class="mthi">Q</span> <i>always</i> has exactly two zeros, one negative and one positive. We are naturally interested in the positive one.</p>
<p>Assume now that we have found the (positive) root <span class="mthi">x</span>. We then have from (4) and (1),<br />
\[<br />
p+q = x \sqrt{a^2-b^2} \quad \hbox{and} \quad<br />
p-q = \frac{a^2-b^2}{p+q} = \frac{1}{x} \sqrt{a^2-b^2},<br />
\]<br />
and then<br />
\[<br />
p = \tfrac{1}{2} \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) \sqrt{a^2-b^2},<br />
\]<br />
and finally<br />
\[<br />
w = \sqrt{a^2-p^2}.<br />
\]<br />
And that is the width we were looking for. Note, however, that if \(p &gt; a\) then no solution is possible. This can happen, for example, if the crossing height <span class="mthi">h</span> is larger than the shortest ladder.</p>
<p>But how do we solve (3) and find <span class="mthi">x</span>? It is possible to solve a quartic equation analytically, so let us turn to <a href="/book/link.php?id=abramowitz">Abramowitz and Stegun</a> and <a href="http://people.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_17.htm">solve it</a>. By carefully inserting to retrieve the positive root we get<br />
\[<br />
x = \tfrac{1}{4} c + \tfrac{1}{4} \sqrt{c^2 + 4 u} + \tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{\left( \tfrac{1}{2} c + \tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{c^2 + 4 u} \right)^2 + 2 \sqrt{u^2+4} - 2 u}<br />
\]<br />
where<br />
\[<br />
u = \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\tfrac{64}{27}+\tfrac{1}{4} c^4}-\tfrac{1}{2} c^2}<br />
  &#8211; \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\tfrac{64}{27}+\tfrac{1}{4} c^4}+\tfrac{1}{2} c^2}.<br />
\]</p>
<p>That concludes the solution to the crossed ladders problem. Let us finish by inserting some numbers.</p>
<p>From the initial illustration of the problem, we have \(a=12\), \(b=10\) and \(h=5\). This gives us<br />
\[<br />
w \simeq 4.2973280047205172448618937103219913746175.<br />
\]<br />
There are actually lengths that have an integer solution. Take, <a href="http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/ladders.html">for instance</a>, \(a=119\), \(b=70\), \(h=30\) and \(w=56\).</p>
<p>A simple, but tricky, problem.</p>
