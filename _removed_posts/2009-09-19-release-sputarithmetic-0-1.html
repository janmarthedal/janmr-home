<p><em>Update 2011-09-28: Both the name and the hosting of this library have changed since this post was first published. See the <a href="https://github.com/janmarthedal/kanooth-numbers">project page</a> for up-to-date information.</em></p>
<p>This is the first release of the SputArithmetic library. You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sputsoftnumbers/files/">download the library</a> or read about it.</p>
<span></span>
<p>From the project page:</p>
<p>SputArithmetic is a portable library written in C++ for doing multiple-precision arithmetic. The underlying theory and design as well as release announcements can be found among the <a href="/tag/numbers-project">numbers project articles</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the library was created mainly to support/test the theory of <a href="/tag/multiple-precision">those articles</a>. It has been made open source in the hope that people may find it useful. The library has a free and permissive <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/license.html">license</a> and it should be very easy to use because of its portability and the fact that it is header based only (depends on some <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> libraries for access to portable <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/integer/index.html">type traits</a>, <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm">shared pointers</a>, and <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/random/">random number generators</a>, but they are header based also). If you look for a thoroughly tested and highly optimized multiple-precision library, you should probably look at the <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> instead.</p>
