title: Six Circles Theorem Illustrated
layout: post
excerpt: ! "Given a triangle, start with a circle tangent to two sides. Then draw a new circle tangent to this first circle and a different pair of sides. Continue this process in the same direction. The sixth circle will be tangent to both the fifth and the first circle, thus producing a cyclic chain of touching circles."

Given a triangle, start with a circle tangent to two sides. Then draw a new circle tangent to this first circle and a different pair of sides. Continue this process in the same direction. The sixth circle will be tangent to both the fifth and the first circle, thus producing a cyclic chain of touching circles.

In the illustration above, the corners of the triangle can be dragged around. Similarly, the center of one of the circles is marked with a little dot which can also be dragged to change the size of the first circle of the chain. A [full-screen version]({{site.baseurl}}media/intgfx/six-circles-theorem.html) of the illustration is also available.

*Update 2014-05-31:* The paper [*The Six Circles Theorem revisited* (pdf)](http://www.math.psu.edu/tabachni/prints/Circles.pdf) by D.&nbsp;Ivanov and [S.&nbsp;Tabachnikov](http://www.math.psu.edu/tabachni/) looks at some generalization of the theorem (thanks to [@theoremoftheday](https://twitter.com/theoremoftheday) for the link).
