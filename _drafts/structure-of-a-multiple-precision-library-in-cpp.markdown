This post will present an overview of my [Kanooth Numbers](https://github.com/janmarthedal/kanooth-numbers) library. The overall approach described here could easily be applicable to others as well.

### Low-level Functions

[GNU MP low-level functions](https://gmplib.org/manual/Low_002dlevel-Functions.html)

### Number Objects

Natural number

Integer

### Operator Overloading

Since Boost 1.53, [Boost Multiprecision](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multiprecision/)
