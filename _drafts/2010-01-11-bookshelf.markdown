<div style="float:right"><a href="&#47;book&#47;link.php?id=tao"><img src="&#47;book&#47;tao.jpg" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;div>
This page contains a few of the books on my bookshelf. Common for them all is that they relate to mathematics and&#47;or computer science and that I recommend them. I plan to gradually expand this page as I get around to writing a few words on some of the great books that are placed on the shelf. And of course, whenever I have finished reading a book that I can recommend, I will make a note of it here&#8212;perhaps together with a more thorough review.

I am currently reading <a href="&#47;book&#47;link.php?id=tao">Solving Mathematical Problems: A Personal Perspective<&#47;a> by Terence Tao.

You can find links to other people's book recommendations among my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;delicious.com&#47;kanooth&#47;book+recommends">bookmarks<&#47;a>.

<h3>Abelson and Sussman: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs<&#47;h3>

<div style="float:right"><a href="&#47;book&#47;link.php?id=sicp"><img src="&#47;book&#47;sicp.jpg" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;div>
This book has influenced <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.billthelizard.com&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;sicp-challenge.html">many<&#47;a> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;sites.google.com&#47;site&#47;steveyegge2&#47;ten-challenges">people<&#47;a>, not at least students at MIT and other universities, where it has been used for teaching computer science for many years. Further, the book itself and a lot of supplementary material is available <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mitpress.mit.edu&#47;sicp&#47;">online<&#47;a> for free.

The book uses <a href=http:&#47;&#47;groups.csail.mit.edu&#47;mac&#47;projects&#47;scheme&#47;">MIT Scheme<&#47;a>, a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp<&#47;a> flavour, exclusively for all programs (or snippets thereof). The beauty of Lisp is that the syntax and semantics is so simple that its can be explained very quickly. On the other hand, it is so feature-rich that the authors can introduce basic programming concepts such as imperative&#47;functional programming, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, common data structures, and many other using this language. A big part of the book is also spent on interpreters (an interpreter for Scheme is developed in Scheme itself) and compilers. And that is what this book is about: Introducing central concepts in computer science, seen through the eyes of Lisp.

<h3>Conway and Guy: The Book of Numbers<&#47;h3>

<div style="float:right"><a href="&#47;book&#47;link.php?id=conway-guy"><img src="&#47;book&#47;conway-guy.jpg" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;div>
<em>The Book of Numbers<&#47;em> is a wonderful book about, well, numbers. And lots of them. From ancient ways of writing numbers to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Gaussian_integer">Gaussian integers<&#47;a> to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Surreal_number">surreal numbers<&#47;a>. With a vast amount of topics and only 300 pages, no topic is treated in depth, some taking up only half a page. But many of the facts stated or questions raised in this book are nontrivial. I found myself repeatedly staring blankly into the air, wondering about some result or comment from the book&#8212;or simply thinking that I had to find some more information on this subject. And that is, in my opinion, a great quality for a math book.

<h3>Derbyshire: Prime Obsession<&#47;h3>

<div style="float:right"><a href="&#47;book&#47;link.php?id=derbyshire03"><img src="&#47;book&#47;derbyshire03.jpg" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;div>
<em>Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics<&#47;em> is a book about the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann Hypothesis<&#47;a>, posed by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Bernhard_Riemann">Bernhard Riemann<&#47;a> in 1859. As the book title says, it is one of the greatest unsettled mathematical conjectures remaining today. It is among <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;David_Hilbert">David Hilbert<&#47;a>'s <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Hilbert_problems">list of twenty-three mathematical problems<&#47;a> and one of the seven <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.claymath.org&#47;millennium&#47;">millennium problems<&#47;a> presented by the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.claymath.org&#47;">Clay Mathematics Institute<&#47;a>. It could be called a popular math book, meaning that it is a narrative and the math is not too advanced. While describing the history and mathematics of the Riemann Hypothesis, the author manages to make to story interesting from beginning to end. The break-throughs, the set-backs, the key persons, the seemingly random events that suddenly made this unsolved problem interesting again.

<h3>K&ouml;rner: The Pleasures of Counting<&#47;h3>

<em>The Pleasures of Counting<&#47;em> is a book about people working with mathematics and challenges they have faced. It addresses history, short biographies, mathematical theories, physics, biology, to name some. Apart from many applications of mathematics, most chapters contain a lot of background information including politics, historical events, relations between the individual characters, and so on. At least half of the book, I would say, is this kind of background information. It was included, I think, to not only focus on applications of mathematics, but also to present the persons behind the mathematics in a historical, cultural and political context.

<h3>Nelson: Proofs Without Words<&#47;h3>

<div style="float:right"><a href="&#47;book&#47;link.php?id=pww2"><img src="&#47;book&#47;pww2.jpg" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;div>

<em>Proofs Without Words<&#47;em> and <em>Proofs Without Words II<&#47;em> are filled with visualizations of theorems from geometry, algebra, trigonometry, inequalities, sequences, series, and others. One page is typically dedicated to each visualization and each book contains around 130 pages. You don't read these books from start to end, but flick through them and find interesting, odd, elegant, strange, and wonderful visualizations. People may be sceptical about so-called visual proofs, but I think they have a place in (recreational) mathematics, if only for inspiration. This site has several <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kanooth.com&#47;blog&#47;tag&#47;visualization">articles<&#47;a> related to visualizations, most of whose figures can also be found in these books.
