<em>Update 2011-09-28: Both the name and the hosting of this library have changed since this post was first published. See the <a href="&#47;numbers&#47;">project page<&#47;a> for up-to-date information.<&#47;em>

This is the first release of the SputArithmetic library. You can <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;sputsoftnumbers&#47;files&#47;">download the library<&#47;a> or <a href="&#47;numbers&#47;">read about it<&#47;a>.

From the <a href="&#47;numbers&#47;">project page<&#47;a>:

SputArithmetic is a portable library written in C++ for doing multiple-precision arithmetic.&nbsp;The underlying theory and design as well as release announcements can be found among the&nbsp;<a href="&#47;blog&#47;tag&#47;numbers-project">numbers project articles<&#47;a>.

Note that the library was created mainly to support&#47;test the theory of <a href="&#47;blog&#47;tag&#47;multiple-precision">those articles<&#47;a>. It has been made open source in the hope that people may find it useful. The library has a free and permissive&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.boost.org&#47;users&#47;license.html">license<&#47;a> and it should be very easy to use because of its portability and the fact that it is header based only (depends on some&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.boost.org">Boost<&#47;a> libraries for access to portable&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.boost.org&#47;doc&#47;libs&#47;release&#47;libs&#47;integer&#47;index.html">type traits<&#47;a>,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.boost.org&#47;doc&#47;libs&#47;1_43_0&#47;libs&#47;smart_ptr&#47;shared_ptr.htm">shared pointers<&#47;a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.boost.org&#47;doc&#47;libs&#47;release&#47;libs&#47;random&#47;">random number generators<&#47;a>, but they are header based also). If you look for a thoroughly tested and highly optimized multiple-precision library, you should probably look at the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;gmplib.org&#47;">GNU&nbsp;Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library<&#47;a> instead.
