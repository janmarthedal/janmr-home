Kanooth Numbers is a C++ library for doing multiple-precision arithmetic. The library is header-only and supposed to be highly portable.

It serves two main purposes:
<ul>
	<li>A generic multiple-precision backend that builds on the <a href="&#47;blog&#47;tag&#47;numbers-project+basic-theory">theory presented on this blog<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
	<li>A simple and robust C++ interface to use the multiple-precision number types. This does not include overloading arithmetic operators such as <span class="sputcode">+<&#47;span>, <span class="sputcode">-<&#47;span> and <span class="sputcode">*<&#47;span>.<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>
Browse or download the code from the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;janmarthedal&#47;kanooth-numbers">GitHub project page<&#47;a>.
